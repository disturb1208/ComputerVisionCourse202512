# Vision Project

This project is a Python-based computer vision application designed to process images using a configurable pipeline. It utilizes **OpenCV** for image manipulation and analysis.

## Project Overview

The core functionality resides in `main.py`, which implements a pipeline architecture to process images. The current setup is configured to detect edges and contours in an input image (`Image_20251210104315649.bmp`) and visualize the results by overlaying centroids and labels.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Python:** Core programming language.
*   **OpenCV (`opencv-python`):** Used for all image processing tasks (loading, blurring, edge detection, contour finding, drawing).
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and array handling.

## File Structure

*   `main.py`: The entry point script. It defines the `process_image` function and the execution pipeline.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
*   `Image_20251210104315649.bmp`: The source image currently being processed.
*   `processed_result.jpg`: The output image generated by the script, containing the visual results of the processing.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *   The script will load `Image_20251210104315649.bmp`.
    *   It will apply the configured processing steps (Blur -> Canny Edge -> Contour Detection).
    *   It will display the result in a window (press any key to close).
    *   It will save the annotated result to `processed_result.jpg`.

## Development Details

### Pipeline Configuration
The processing logic is defined in `main.py` via a `pipeline_config` list. Each step is a dictionary containing the operation type and its parameters.

**Supported Operations:**

*   **`blur`**: Applies Gaussian Blur.
    *   `type`: "gaussian"
    *   `ksize`: Kernel size (must be odd).
*   **`edge`**: Applies Canny Edge Detection.
    *   `method`: "canny"
    *   `threshold1`: First threshold for the hysteresis procedure.
    *   `threshold2`: Second threshold for the hysteresis procedure.
    *   `ksize`: Aperture size for the Sobel operator.
*   **`contour`**: Finds and filters contours.
    *   `thresholdValue`: (Implicitly used if manual thresholding were added, though Canny output is already binary).
    *   `retrievalMode`: Contour retrieval mode (e.g., "TREE", "EXTERNAL", "LIST").
    *   `minArea`: Minimum area to retain a contour.
    *   `showBoundingBox`: Boolean to draw bounding boxes.
    *   `showCentroid`: Boolean to draw centroids.
    *   `showLabel`: Boolean to draw labels (ID and Area).

### Modifying the Pipeline
To change the processing logic, edit the `pipeline_config` variable in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block of `main.py`. You can adjust parameters or reorder steps.
